# License

kbRelay is licensed under the **Elastic License 2.0** (ELv2). The full,
verbatim license text appears below.

> **Copyright (c) 2026 LaLa Solutions. All rights reserved.**

---

## 1. In plain English

The legal text below is what governs. This summary is informal; if it
conflicts with the legal text, the legal text wins.

### What you may do

- **Use** kbRelay in production, internally, for any purpose within
  your organization.
- **Modify** the source code freely.
- **Distribute** modified or unmodified copies to others.
- **Build commercial products on top of kbRelay**, provided kbRelay
  itself is not the product you offer as a service. (e.g., a company
  that self-hosts kbRelay to coordinate its own agents and staff, or a
  consultancy that stands up kbRelay for a client, is fine; reselling
  "kbRelay hosted by us" is not.)

### What you may not do

- **Offer kbRelay, or a substantially-equivalent fork, to third
  parties as a hosted, managed, or SaaS service.** This is the
  load-bearing protection — it prevents a competitor from cloning the
  repo and selling kbRelay-as-a-Service.
- **Remove or modify any license-key or licensing-enforcement
  functionality** that we may add.
- **Strip or obscure copyright, licensing, or attribution notices.**

### Termination

If you violate the license, your rights end automatically. If we
notify you and you cure the violation within 30 days, the license is
reinstated retroactively. Repeat violations terminate the license
permanently.

### No warranty

The software is provided "as is." We're not liable for damages from
its use, to the maximum extent the law allows.

## 2. Why ELv2 and not [permissive license / GPL / proprietary]?

| Option | Why we passed |
|---|---|
| **MIT / Apache 2.0** | Permissive. Anyone can fork kbRelay and offer it as a paid hosted service in direct competition. Eliminates monetization optionality. |
| **AGPL** | Strong copyleft, but the SaaS workaround (running it as a hosted service without distributing modified source) is hotly contested and varies by jurisdiction. ELv2 explicitly closes the SaaS-hosting loophole. |
| **Proprietary / closed source** | Defeats the goal of public source for community visibility, contribution, and trust. |
| **BSL 1.1** | Also a strong fit. Each version auto-converts to Apache 2.0 after a configurable delay (e.g., 4 years), which can be friendlier to community comfort but reduces long-term protection. ELv2 stays protective indefinitely. |

ELv2 is industry-recognized (Elastic, Sentry pre-2023, Redis) and
permits exactly the use cases we want to permit (internal use,
modification, building products on top, self-hosting) while preventing
the one we don't (kbRelay-as-a-Service competitors).

## 3. Commercial licensing

If you want to offer kbRelay or a kbRelay-derived service to third
parties — managed hosting, white-labeled SaaS, embedded in a product
you sell where kbRelay's functionality is the value being sold —
you'll need a commercial license from us.

We're open to conversation; reach out before you build, not after.

## 4. Disclaimer

This `LICENSE.md` reproduces the canonical ELv2 text verbatim, but
the file as a whole — including the framing, the in-plain-English
summary, and the contact information — has not been reviewed by
counsel for this specific repository. Before publishing the
repository publicly, especially given monetization intent, we
strongly recommend:

1. **Confirm the legal entity and contact.** Verify the exact legal
   entity name ("LaLa Solutions" vs. a registered variant), the
   copyright assignment, and the commercial-licensing contact address.
2. **Review with your attorney.** Confirm ELv2 fits your jurisdiction
   and product strategy.
3. **Decide on a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or Developer
   Certificate of Origin (DCO).** Public repos that accept outside
   contributions need one of these to ensure you can re-license
   contributions in the future. kbRelay uses the DCO (see
   [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).
4. **Add a `NOTICE` file** if you redistribute third-party components
   under their own licenses (Apache 2.0 dependencies in particular
   require attribution). A `pnpm licenses list` audit at publish time
   is worth the 30 minutes.
5. **Add a license header to source files** (recommended but not
   required) — see the header block in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
